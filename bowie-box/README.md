<h5>Songs and functionality.</h5>
<p>The Bowie Box comes loaded with 5 songs. "Space Oddity", "Rebel Rebel", "Ziggy Stardust", "Let's Dance", and "Changes". To play a song you simple open the page and use the drop down selector labeled "choose a song" to select the song. Once the song is selected it will automatically start. The stop button will send the currentTime of the track to 0. The Pause button will stop the track at its current time and resume if play is pressed. The next song button will start playing the next option in the dropdown menu.</p>

<h6>Color Scheme</h6>
<img src=("images/bowie.png")/>
<p>We used this image as the backdrop and made it the color scheme for the site. Three colors are defined from the begining. $blueish is the same as the blue lightning on Bowie's face, and $redish is taken from Bowie's chinstrap in the image. $bluepac is also used as a version of $blueish that has an opacity of 1.</p>
<h6>Class headliner</h6>
<p>The headliner class is used for the title of the site. It is placed absolutely in the top left corner of the page. We used the same red color from Bowies hair in the image for the title. We also used the font family "Bangers" found on google fonts. The title is also transformed and titled -19 degrees.</p>
